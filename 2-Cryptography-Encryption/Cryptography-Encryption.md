## Cryptography and Encryption
-----------------------------------------------------

Cryptography is the science of concealing messages with a secret code. 

Encryption is the way to encrypt and decrypt data. 

The first is about studying methods to keep a message secret between two parties (like symmetric and asymmetric keys), and the second is about the process itself.


- *PUBLIC KEY*  
Uses one key for encryption and another for decryption; also called asymmetric encryption. Primarily used for authentication, non-repudiation, and key exchange.  

1. ECC and ECSDA
2. BIP 32 & 39 (Based on ECC)
3. 

- *HASHING ALGORITHMS*  
Uses a mathematical transformation to irreversibly "encrypt" information, providing a digital fingerprint. Primarily used for message integrity.  

1. SHA-256
2. KECCAK
3. RIPEMD

- *ENCODING*  
1. RLP
